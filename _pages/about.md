----------
Hi! I am Yiyi Cai, a senior at Caltech, where I am studying electrical engineering. I am broadly interested in the interplay of theoretical computer science and quantum information, including quantum algorithms, coding theory, complexity theory, and cryptography. I hope to apply tools in TCS to discover relevant physical phenomena. In the past, I have worked on quantum machine learning for high energy physics, error analysis in analog quantum systems, and quantum error correction for trapped ion platforms. 

I will be pursuing a MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge as a [Gates-Cambridge Scholar](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/yiyi_cai_gates_cambridge_scholarship) starting in Fall 2025, followed by a PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University in Fall 2026. I am a Mellon Mays Undergraduate Research fellow, and I am grateful to have been awarded the Stanford Graduate Fellowship (SGF), the NSF Graduate Student Fellowship (GRFP), and the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (NDSEG), where the latter two are declined due to deferral policies.
