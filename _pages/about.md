Hi! I am Yiyi Cai, a senior at Caltech, where I am studying electrical engineering. I am interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science and physics, particularly the field of quantum information theory. I hope to continue exploring concrete tasks quantum computers can perform with provable guarantees. In the past, I have worked on quantum machine learning for high energy physics, error analysis in analog quantum systems, and quantum error correction for trapped ion platforms. 

I am grateful to be supported by the Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship. I will be pursuing a MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge as a Gates-Cambridge Scholar, starting in fall of 2025, followed by a PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University in fall of 2026.
