Hi! I am Yiyi Cai, a fourth-year undergraduate student at California Institute of Technology, where I am studying [electrical engineering](https://www.ee.caltech.edu/). I am interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science and physics, particularly the field of quantum information theory. At Caltech, I am extremely fortunate to have worked with [Yu Tong](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/yu.tong), [Chris Pattison](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4neYf8oAAAAJ&hl=en), and [John Preskill](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/). Feel free to reach me at yiyi@caltech.edu!
