Hi! I am Yiyi Cai, currently pursuing a MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Cambridge as a [Gates-Cambridge Scholar](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/yiyi_cai_gates_cambridge_scholarship), advised by Tom Gur. I am broadly interested in the interplay of theoretical computer science and quantum information, including quantum algorithms, coding theory, complexity theory, and cryptography. I hope to apply tools in TCS to discover relevant physical phenomena. Previously, I completed my B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Caltech. I am starting my PhD in Computer Science at Stanford University in Fall 2026, supported by the Stanford Graduate Fellowship.
