Yiyi Cai

Hi! I am Yiyi Cai, a fourth-year undergraduate student at Caltech, where I am studying electrical engineering. I am interested in the intersection of theoretical computer science and physics, particularly the field of quantum information theory. At Caltech, I am extremely fortunate to have worked with [Yu Tong](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/yu.tong), [Chris Pattison](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4neYf8oAAAAJ&hl=en), and [John Preskill](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/). 

My current research focuses on improving code parameters of asymptotically good qLDPC codes and investigating Gibbs state product structure in high temperature. In the past, I have worked on quantum machine learning for high energy physics, error analysis in analog quantum systems, and quantum error correction for ion trapped platforms. I hope to continue exploring concrete tasks quantum computers can perform with provable guarantees. 

I am grateful to be supported by the [Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship](https://www.mellon.org/mmuf).
